# Beginning Experiments in Generative Music

Just sketching out ideas at the moment. End goal is to be able to analyze a melody that's played live, and generate a backing track automatically. 

This component is for analyzing what key you're in, and potentially defining chord progressions. Synthesis will be handled externally to this project most likely. 


## Gotchas to watch for

- be careful of counting arrays (0-indexed) vs some of my note naming schemes which are 1-indexed


## General TODOs

- common "definitions" file required by all the modules? includes chord, scales, rootvals, etc
